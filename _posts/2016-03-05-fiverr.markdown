Fiverr - it's not always $5

Once you post, you get a whole bunch of replies, and the expectation is that you gotta get back, right, away!
But I had to play on my terms. I selected a few people and payed them $5 to get "used to our system".
This helped me winnow down the list to the ones I know will work well. Now I am hoping they will be free
to work on my project when I need them in 2 weeks.
