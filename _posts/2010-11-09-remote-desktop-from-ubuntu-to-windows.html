<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">When I first tried to remote into my work machine, man that thing was slow. My good pal helped me figure out a set of command line options to make it usable. The main things to do were to set the command line option to have rdesktop compress the data, and to minimize the themes on my Windows machine. Now I feel like the remote experience is faster on my Ubuntu machine than it was from my Windows machines... ofcourse my Windows machines had much slower hardware.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div>
