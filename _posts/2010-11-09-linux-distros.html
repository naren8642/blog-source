So on my new machine, I installed Ubuntu Maverick. Felt like I should go with the latest out there. Right? I also played with some other live cds and I really liked <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>. The package management and system settings are better laid out and accessible.<br /><br />The first few days were nice and shiny and calm. Then I started doing some real stuff on my new machine.
