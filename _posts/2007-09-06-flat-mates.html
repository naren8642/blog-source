Next to me are Natalie and Andrew<span style="font-family: arial;"></span> who have been living in this house for a while. At the other end is Amy who had just moved in a week before I did.<br /><br />We had a flatmate night in and Andrew cooked some awesome risotto, chicken, grilled mushrooms and spinach. The mushrooms were simply divine, just a bit of feta and some oyster sauce, a few mins on the grill, and voila!<br /><br />There are more pictures on the "week four" pictures on the sidebar.
