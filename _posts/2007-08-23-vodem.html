To be able to work from here, I have to have a reliable internet connection that is available to me all the time. There is very limited free Wifi in Auckland and even the available ones are configured for limited access.<br /><br />They had different plans and promotions on the Vodem, but since I only needed it for a couple of months, I went with the monthly plan and just bought a used device from <a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz/">TradeMe</a>.<br /><br />It was pretty cool the other day, we had to go to the printers and the binders to get Anna's thesis done. Chu was driving, I was sitting in the back seat and working as we were driving down the streets of Auckland.
