The rugby world cup just started in France, and that's been dominating all news here. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=A1YourView&amp;xml=/sport/2007/09/10/srnewz110.xml">The All Blacks won</a> their opening match against Italy resoundingly. As is their tradition, the All Blacks performed the traditional Maori Haka before the game started. The Italians got together in a huddle during this, a move that was <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4195822a22363.html">taken as a snub</a> to the haka.<br /><br /><object height="353" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Hc6fuKQacJA"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Hc6fuKQacJA" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="353" width="425"></embed></object><br /><br />I think it's really awesome that the All Blacks do this before every game. It's really cool to watch.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://lh6.google.com/naren.salem/RuTlNkyzZVI/AAAAAAAAB10/DwchTpqde7E/s144/DSCF3369.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;" src="http://lh6.google.com/naren.salem/RuTlNkyzZVI/AAAAAAAAB10/DwchTpqde7E/s144/DSCF3369.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />Last Friday, Chu and I went to see a real live rugby game here in Auckland. It was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_rugby_league_and_rugby_union">different game</a> though because it was the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_league">rugby league</a>". The Auckland Warriors didn't win though. But it was fun being out there in the field with all the very vocal rugby fans.
