No it is not because having more black pixels on a computer monitor will reduce the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/is-black-new-green.html">energy used by the monitor</a>. It's actually because of the "<a href="http://www.allblacks.com/">All Blacks</a>", <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Blacks">the national Rugby Union team</a> of New Zealand.<br /><br />Then again everyone looks better in black - no matter what they say, black will always be the new black.
