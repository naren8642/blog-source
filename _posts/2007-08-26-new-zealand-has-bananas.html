If you read the word in context, that is. I have heard the term "banana" applied to a person of East Asian origin who is more "white" inside, despite their "yellow" skin. But back in the US we use that term in hushed whispers and people giggle when they say it. But the bananas here in New Zealand have a conference of their own and took out a full page ad for it. As Chu likes to say, "Cool bananas man!"
