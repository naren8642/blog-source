<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Work uses Lotus groupware. So I needed my IM client to connect to Sametime at work. Yes Pidgin and Empathy do that, but they were not showing me all my online contacts. After some browsing around it turned out that the meanwhile library had the bug in it and I had to get the source code for it and compile it to get the fix because the new packages were not released yet. I'm getting to be a geek now.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div>
