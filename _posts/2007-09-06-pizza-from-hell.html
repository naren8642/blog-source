It was Chu, John, Corrina and me. We got the pizza from Hell's pizza.<br /><br />You might have already heard about the backlash to <a href="http://www.familyfirst.org.nz/index.cfm/action_alert_/hell_s_pizza.html">their name</a> and <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4175791a6009.html">ad campaign</a>, but it's actually quite a <a href="http://www.wotzon.com/profilepage.html?comp_id=1002507&amp;CatID=">solid franchise</a> here in New Zealand and they are planning on expanding to the UK and even the US.<br /><br />Their marketing is pretty all-out though, snazzy ads, they've got the 666 prefix for the phone number, and actually a <a href="http://digg.com/business_finance/Welcome_to_Hell_Best_Pizza_Delivery_Website_Ever">very cool</a> web-site - <a href="http://www.hell.co.nz/">http://www.hell.co.nz/</a> where you can select toppings and sauces and what side of the pizza gets what, and you can even play with the little flash devils :)
