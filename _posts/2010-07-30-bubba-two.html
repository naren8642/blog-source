I was killing some time at Barnes and Noble the other day and ended up browsing the <a href="http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/">Linux User and Developer</a> magazine. (Why is it that I get an impression that Linux thrives more in the UK?) Anyway I saw this <a href="http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/reviews/bubba-two-wifi-review/">article about a pretty cool home server</a> based on Linux. Yeah, it is called the <a href="http://www.excito.com/">Bubba Two</a>. But I love the looks and the specs. Anyone out there have one of these? Wonder how it measures up in useability terms.
