This place is really close to Chu's place, the rent was most reasonable that we found and to top it all off, the others living here are awesome.<br /><br />There is a couple and a single person other than me. It's so much better moving in with flat-mates rather than finding a separate apartment because I don't have to buy everything to make the place livable.
