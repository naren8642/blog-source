I've been playing with Linux again. It all got started when I got fed up with using ghost images of test machines at work and decided to go with virtual machines. This time around, my desktop machine had sufficient specs to work nicely with virtual machines. I borrowed an OpenSuse image from a friend and gave it a go. I was surprised at how easy it was to find and install apps compared to the last time I was on a linux machine.<br /><br />I then started running a copy on my Windows Home Server machine. Things weren't so bad. I was learning more about linux offerings. I was wondering if I could get rid of the ugly WHS web portal and replace it with something nicer.<br /><br />But then I started seeing some weirdness on the WHS. Firstly I got periodical errors from WHS. It didn't like the fact that some of the files in my personal share were "in use". These were the VMWare image files.<br /><br />Secondly the WHS stuff started getting erratic. The system status page wouldn't load. My media backups weren't going smoothly. So I ended up shutting down the virtual machine. I still couldn't get the status page to load. I rebooted. The WHS controller looked a little better. Rebooted again. Even better. Rebooted again, and finally all the panels were back to normal. Gotta love the Windows reboots.
